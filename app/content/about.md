Founders - Illinois Entrepreneurs is a student organization at UIUC founded in 2013 that's dedicated to creating a community of continuous innovation and entrepreneurship. As part of our mission statement, we want to be able to increase the visibility into the vibrant UIUC startup community. There's currently no way for people to examine the entrepreneurship community and explore all of the startups that exist at UIUC. That is, until now.
