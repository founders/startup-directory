Founders - Illinois Entrepreneurs is a student organization at UIUC that's dedicated to creating a community of continuous innovation and entrepreneurship. As part of our mission statement, we want to be able to increase the visibility into the startup community. There's currently no way for people to examing the
entrepreneurship community and explore all of the startups that exist at UIUC. That is, until now.

The Startup Directory is Founders' attempt at unifying startups on campus. Startups can register with the directory and upload information about themselves for the world to see. As more and more students attend Founders events and begin creating their own ventures, our directory will contain more information about the greater entrepreneurship community. Click into any of the listed startups to learn more about them.
