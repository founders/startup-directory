Registering your Startup with the Founders Startup Directory has never been easier.

## Step 1: Confirming Your Email
The Founders Startup Directory requires users to validate their email address and startup name before we allow you to create an account with us. To do so, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/i9mPTqByaueSQi1KA) to request a spot on our email whitelist. You will recieve an email as soon as possible with either an acceptance or rejection to whitelist this email.

If your request is accepted, [sign in](/api/auth/login) with the same email to create an account. Otherwise, feel free to reach out to us with an appeal.

## Step 2: Creating an Account
Once your email has been whitelisted, you can create an account by [signing in](/api/auth/login) with Google. The email that you register with should be the same one that we whitelisted. Upon creating an account, you can either **join an existing startup** or **create a new startup**.

### Joining An Existing Startup
To join an existing startup, simply request access by searching for your startup and clicking "Request to Join *Startup*". The owner of the startup page will recieve a request for you to join their organization, and they can either accept or reject your request to join.

### Creating A New Startup
To create a new startup, you can click "Create A Page" on the onboarding screen and follow the registration form to load information about your startup. You will have to fill out some information regarding your startup, such as your startups name, description, logo, etc.

## Step 3: Browse!
Congradulations, you have registered with the Founders Startup Directory! Feel free to take a look at all the startups that UIUC has to offer.
