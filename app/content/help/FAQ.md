## How to Create my own Start-Up Posting?

In order to create your own posting, create an account by clicking "Sign Up / Register". You can then create a new Startup by filling out all the required forms.
After clicking "Submit", you won't see your startup in our list right away. Your submission needs to be approved by a member of the Founders team, which should take anywhere from 1-3 business days. Once your submission is seen and approved, you will be able to see your startup on the directory! If for any reason your submission is not approved, a member of Founders will reach out to you with additional questions.
