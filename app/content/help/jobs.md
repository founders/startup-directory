Currently, the Startup Directory does not support job listings.

You can, however, toggle the _"Hiring"_ status for your startup on your [account](/account). This will let other people know that your startup is hiring. We recommend using LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Angel List, and other software to post job listings. (We do, however, hope to support native job listings in 2022!)

Also, [contact us](mailto:team@founders.illinois.edu) for any product requests and nits. We're always looking for community feedback on our products.
