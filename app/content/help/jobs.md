Currently, the Startup Directory at Founders does not have native Job Listings. However, you CAN tell others that you're looking to hire! On your "Account" section, check off "Looking to Hire" to tell students and potential hires that you're looking to grow your company.

We recommend using LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Angel List, and other software to post job listings. We do, however, hope to support native job listings in 2021!


Also, [contact us](mailto:team@founders.illinois.edu) for any product requests and nits. We're always looking for community feedback on our products.
